"This was the first Sociology class I've taken, and Professor Crutchfield was really a great professor. One thing I'll tell you is that reading the textbook is absolutely NECESSARY.

"All teachers play favorites, but Brooks took it to extremes I have never before seen. If he likes you he'll spend all the time you need with you, and if he doesn't you're screwed. Knows his stuff and the class is well organized but a teacher who is too jaded to teach everybody is worthless. Very disappointing.",1.0,0.9710813232697374,0.0,0.5382871627807617,1.0,0.6702209711074829,1.0,0.13123668730258942

"I am not sure if he even understood what he was saying half of the time. He clearly knew what he was trying to teach us, but his ability to actually explain these complex ideas was lost on about 90% if the class. The speed of the class was way too fast for newbies to learn too.",0.0,0.9875945019618768,0.0,0.5382910370826721,0.0,0.4988659620285034,0.0,0.9926131963729858
