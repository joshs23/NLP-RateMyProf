"It's not hard class, but don't expect the 4.0. She isn't clear about what is expected and the syllabus changed multiple times over the quarter. You can tell she doesn't take business students seriously and makes you feel awkward about your responses which really discourages participation.",0,0.5382910966873169,0,0.49893999099731445
"Syllabus was clear on what the daily homework was, which was a huge help for the quarter! Would recommend uploading her powerpoint presentations before her class to stay keep up with lectures; what she says verbally shows up on the midterms! Also reading the textbook helped!! Overall, good professor but her lectures are a bore.",0,0.5382909774780273,0,0.5023043155670166
"Bridge is the coolest prof I've ever had. His joy and passion of the subjects he teaches is next level. He's always telling stories that relate to the subject in interesting ways. Easy grader and really cares that the students fully understand, and succeed in his course. Clear and fair expectations, do the homeworks and you'll excel on the exams.",0,0.5382917523384094,0,0.49894028902053833
Bridge makes it abundantly clear what you need to know to get a good grade. If you listen to him and take notes you can do well in any of his classes. He is forgiving and understanding so long as you make the effort. If you don't show up... good luck. The most fair professor I have ever had. Hell of a person and tells the best stories!,0,0.5382907390594482,0,0.5058503150939941

"Awesome teacher! Print out his pre-made class guide and take notes on those. He always points out the necessary equations and does at least one practice problem with the class so you can look at it during hw. Do the hw and the tests are straightforward from there. However, no online notes so attendance is needed.",0,0.5382904410362244,0,0.49972906708717346
"Very long and boring lectures which cover little new material, but a bit more in depth coverage of material from 5 course prerequisites.  DETAILS are key.  Get the textbook from India for $30, it's low quality and the homework problems may be a bit different, but all you really need are the tables.",0,0.538290799,0,0.5001103281974792

"He is very clear with his expectations & his grading scale which is nice. However there always seems to be something on the exam that was barely covered or unexpected. A pretty harsh grader, docks you 10 pts for seemingly innocent mistakes. My advice is to visit him in office hours (very helpful there) a lot. Takes a while to get him but he's fun.",0,0.538290799,0,0.5008073449134827
"I've had three classes with him 315: The class is poorly structured and exams don't correlate well with material, but its not entirely his fault because the ME program lacks some areas of knowledge which he tries to squeeze into this course 343: Difficult material and lectures but he does a solid job 223: Fantastic dynamics teacher",0,0.5382980108261108,0,0.49932512640953064
"His grading can be rather harsh, but given the set up of the class you should be OK. We were given weekly quizzes (problems straight off of the HW) and those quizzes combined ended up equaling more than the one midterm he gave.   Do ample practice problems from the actual textbook and the optional textbook and you'll be just fine. Go to lecture.",0,0.5382914543151855,0,0.5000334978103638
"Hilarious due to the extreme disconnect between material instructed and major grading assignments.  Didn't really expect a 3d design, modelling, and analysis class to focus so much on design and modelling, yet grade so heavily on Technical Writing, and Linear Algebra.  A complete lack of textbook for the class also served little help.",0,0.5382901430130005,0,0.49915361404418945
"I like him as a person, but he has no idea what he is doing in class. I understand that the ME program is new, but this class as a whole is pointless.

"Professor Oh seems like a great guy, but I have not enjoyed his class. It's very lecture heavy with limited/no slides, which can be really hard to follow. He frequently asks questions of the class where no one is clear what he's asking for -- after 5 or 6 attempts he'll finally tell us the ""answer"", which isn't what he asked for at all...",0,0.5382915139198303,0,0.4986848831176758
"This is not at easy class. But Dr. Oh is a really good teacher. He is a very easy grader when it comes to homework, make sure you study hard on the midterm and final.

"Professor Oh is a great teacher but hard to understand sometimes. I had never taken a business class before 210 and I enjoyed it.

"Dr. Oh is awesome. He is funny and tries his best to teach students that accounting is ""fun and useful"". The course consists of ten HW assignments and three exams (2 midterms, 1 final). The homework was graded very easily.. I only missed 1 point. The exams are straight-forward and questions come from homework/review q's. Extra credit on exams!",0,0.5382928848266602,0,0.49986889958381653
This is a great class. Very short homework and there is always one question he throughly goes over in class. Huge chance that its going to be the same question on the test. Tests arent hard but for the final go over all the homework assignments because he might copy and paste a random question from those.,0,0.5382912755012512,0,0.49971476197242737
"He gets right to the point. Probably one of the best professors ive had. His tests are short and does not take the full 2 hours, and there are extra credit questions on them to. Be aware, getting above a hundred percent only gives you a hundred percent (not 109). Homework is short. He sometimes teaches us stuff not relevant, but still interesting!",0,0.538292646,0,0.5003774762153625
Prof. Oh is an okay teacher. He tries to help us but his lecture is boring and he has a strong Korean accent. He stress that accounting is useful and fun to motivate us.

"He has a thick Korean accent and can be hard to pay attention sometimes. I had to study extra at home and review so that I could fully understand all the stuff we learned in class.

I took Financial Accounting as an elective (didn't need it for my major). Would not recommend taking this class unless you really like accounting or it is required. Prof is funny & nice but sometimes his lectures are confusing and not enough examples. I would highly recommend reading the chapters prior to class so you have a basis of understanding.,0,0.5382909774780273,0,0.4995563328266144

Final was pretty tough.",0,0.5382903218269348,0,0.4995640814304352
Professor Oh is a really funny guy! He really goes out of his way to teach his students  and providing funny examples too. He makes the class laugh and his tests / midterms are based off on assignments. As long as you do the assignment then you're fine. You do have to put in a bit of effort for this class.

Tests are all contrived of the homework he assigns which directly correlates to what he teaches that day.",0,0.5382925868034363,0,0.49857836961746216
A great professor who cares and wants you to understand the basics rather than just memorize them. No reading required because everything on the test in from lecture. If you don't understand something he will explain it as many ways as he can and if you fail it really is because you didn't put any effort into the course. Gives extra credit too!,0,0.5382933616638184,0,0.49877503514289856
"Best professor I have ever had! He is enthusiastic and helpful. Makes a lot of weird, but funny jokes. Homework will take a good amount of time to finish, but they are great study tools for exams.

He is very enthusiastic about Accounting and the opportunities that stem from it. Good amount of homework. Tests are pretty hard. But if you go to class and do the homework you will get a good grade as he gives extra credit to mitigate the difficult tests.,0,0.5382911562919617,0,0.49949756264686584

This was his first time teaching and i think he did great. He makes sure to clarify everything you don't understand and tries to have everyone in class up to pace. He sometimes speaks nonsense but it is hilarious. He is a lenient grader. His tests are short but worth a lot question. As long as you understand the HW from the book you will be okay.,0,0.5382903218269348,0,0.5216008424758911

She's super nice and her class was not at all stressful. I went into her office hours to talk to her and she was really understanding about everything that I was going through.

Professor McLoud-Mann is very straightforward. There is no way you don't pass this class with a higher-than-average grade if you show up and do the homework.

Quite possibly the worst teacher I've ever had period. Her in-class material that she 'teaches' if you can call it that is all so basic compared to the exams and homework she gives you. Almost every problem has super confusing or off-putting wording. Her lectures are the equivalent of teaching 1+12 then asking you to solve calc-level math.,0,0.5382909178733826,0,0.5224284529685974
"Dr. Erin Hill has an interesting teaching methodology . She claims she never lectures but the rare case she does, she calls them 'mini lectures'.

"Loftus' class is very much a computational class. I recommend it to anyone to is more mathematically minded. I found his class very easy, if you do the homework and practice tests.

I am not quite sure why other ratings are so low. I think that these students went into the class with a wrong expectation.

B-Rob's a good enough guy but is extremely unorganized & confusing. Often the material he goes over in class strays from the book & you must learn it because it'll be on the tests.

Amazing discussions!,0,0.5382921695709229,0,0.49965786933898926

"Terry is... a good informer, but a terrible teacher--and sometimes weird. You definitely have to teach yourself in his classes. For novices he goes extremely fast, but for the advanced his lectures are useless. The paper worth 50% of your grade is what you should focus on. Get a different teacher if you can, but he's manageable if you're stuck.",0,0.5382877588272095,0,0.5573511123657227
"Class was pointless. The assignments didn't relate to what he rambled on about during class. There were no guidelines for any of the assignments so you had no idea how you were being graded, especially for the final paper worth 55% of your grade.",0,0.5382904410362244,0,0.5020108819007874

"All teachers play favorites, but Brooks took it to extremes I have never before seen. If he likes you he'll spend all the time you need with you, and if he doesn't you're screwed. Knows his stuff and the class is well organized but a teacher who is too jaded to teach everybody is worthless. Very disappointing.",0,0.5382871627807617,1,0.6702209711074829

"I am not sure if he even understood what he was saying half of the time. He clearly knew what he was trying to teach us, but his ability to actually explain these complex ideas was lost on about 90% if the class.
